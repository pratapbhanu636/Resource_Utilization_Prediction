# Resource_Utilization_Prediction
The Model Forecast the resource utilization of a particular instance in the cloud environment .
As given in problem statement, we are given the transaction logs containing the   historical data of the resource utilization per minute of a particular instance from the time it was created and destroyed, various features like Memory allocated, CPU Allocated,
CPU Used, etc. are given in logs. There are groups also consisting of various instances.
A group data will consist many instances and their log files, I am assuming here that each instance of a group is independent of each other , My understanding of the problem is that we have to forecast the future log file means we have to predict the future resource utilization for a given instance or given group , like how much memory it is going to take how much CPU will it use , We will predict a transactions log for the future .As we have multiple instances per group we will predict the transaction for each instance of that group.
